### Convert Markdown to PDF Offline in Bulk

* **Pre-requisite** Device must have NPM (node) and **Installed** ***md-to-pdf***
* To install ***md-to-pdf*** using NPM use **npm i md-to-pdf**.
* The script is used to do multiple conversions using one click. For a single conversion you can always use console directly to do the task using ***"md-to-pdf <Filename>"***
* The script also uses modules named ***glob*** and ***subprocess*** which come by default in python now. If they are not available then just do a **pip install** for them as well.

* The script is used to rename multiple files or folders inside a folder with a common name or a number appended to it.
* The script can also be used to remove a common name from all the files or folders inside a folder.

### Search and List Remaining Files

* I created this scripts to find the missing files from a site which I forgot to download due to lack of focus while scrolling.
* I created a list of files I have downloaded and a list of all the files there in the site after some pre-processing.
* Then it was a cake walk to check if the main list file's name was in the downloaded file's list.
* The files not present were printed as a list in the python console.
